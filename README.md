### Hi there! 👋

I'm Weyman, a software engineer based in San Francisco. I first got into coding when I took my first computer science course in high school. I ended up deciding to enroll in San Francisco State University as a computer science major. Throughout the years, I really enjoyed the aspect of working with others. From creating documentation to implementing features for projects, I learned several development methodologies that the industry utilizes. In August 2021, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Right after graduating, I was in a situation where I had to take care of my family.

After my family became much healthier, in order to sharpen my skills, I decided to enroll in App Academy, a web development bootcamp in May 2023. While there, I built many projects utlizing technologies such as React, Redux, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I created several projects during this period. This includes: 

* [Well Played](https://well-played-3bbfe2f31839.herokuapp.com/), a social media video game tracker made with 2 other software engineers
* [Hypecamp](https://hypecamp-hbpd.onrender.com/), a clone of popular camping site Hipcamp 
* [Skyview](https://wleung4.github.io/skyview/), a flight tracker web application

In my free time, I usually go out with friends to eat out around the Bay Area, play video games with others, or watch football (Go Niners!). Feel free to reach out to my email: leungweyman@gmail.com
